# 3-Body Problem Simulation

This project visualizes a simplified simulation of the 3-body problem using HTML, JavaScript, and the Canvas API. The simulation allows users to interactively adjust the masses of three celestial bodies and observe their gravitational interactions in real-time.

## Features

- **Interactive Mass Adjustment**: Adjust the masses of the three bodies using sliders before starting the simulation.
- **Collision Handling**: Bodies may collide and merge based on their masses.
- **Real-Time Rendering**: Bodies leave trails that visualize their paths over time.
- **Drag and Drop**: Adjust the initial positions of the bodies by dragging them on the canvas before starting the simulation.

## How to Run

1. Clone or download the project files.
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser to start the simulation.

## Files

- **index.html**: Main HTML file that sets up the structure.
- **main.js**: Contains the logic for the 3-body simulation, including physics calculations and rendering.
- **styles.css**: Styles for the UI elements and canvas.

## Controls

- Adjust the masses of the bodies using the sliders in the pop-up window.
- Click the **Start** button to begin the simulation.
- Drag the bodies to change their initial positions before starting.
- The simulation centers on the heaviest body for better visualization.

## Technologies Used

- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Canvas API for rendering the simulation
